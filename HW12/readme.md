When we began working with TinkerCad it was not entirely new to me. I didn’t use this exact program but back in highschool did do something similar, and this was a really fun refresher on some of those things. I had a really enjoyable time working with the circuits, finding myself playing around with it. Just trying to make whatever was just worked with even more complex, weird and fun. However it did after a point get somewhat repetitive, leading me to move on to the code blocks.  I found that while the code blocks were fun, I was enjoying the puzzle/challenges more than anything else. It was fairly simple but engaging. I  was a good showing of how one could use some of the things we’ve worked with this semester, and how with some work they could really create something interesting.
